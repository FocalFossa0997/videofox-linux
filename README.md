# videofox-linux
VideoFox is a simple application that allows you to perform complex actions on video files without having to type in long ffmpeg commands.  
# How to use
VideoFox has no gui, so you will have to launch it from the command line.Everything else is described in the application.  
# Known problems
- The executable has to be named VideoFox in order for the exit funstion to work  
- The application cannot detect which linux distro you are on, so you will have to manually select the package manager that your system uses  
# Forking and modifying
